Project Description

A healthcare app so users can create and manage any healthcare related appointments. This could be a general visit to the doctor, tests, or operations. When creating an appointment the user would be able to select the kind of appointment this will be, whether it is offline or online (if applicable), choose from available dates, and include any detailed concerns in a message. All appointments would then be presented on the homepage, organized by date, id, or alphabetically according to the user. With just a simple click on the appointment, the user can review the details of the appointment if they forget, see if their doctor has updated the appointment with notes, set a push notification, or share the appointment information with someone else. Past appointments along with doctorâ€™s notes would also be able to be seen in the history tab.
